        <code>ng-scaffolding</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web development projects.
        It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new web sites and apps: just download it and start coding.
        The goal is to have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has slick styles and icons,
        but it also has a best practice directory structure to ensure maximum code reuse.
        And it's all tied together with a robust build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        Because my team and I make web apps, and last year AngularJS became our client-side framework of choice.
        We start websites the same way every time: create a directory structure,
        copy and ever-so-slightly tweak some config files from an older project, and yada yada, etc.,
        and so on and so forth. Why are we repeating ourselves?
        We wanted a starting point; a set of best practices that we could identify our projects as embodying and a set of time-saving wonderfulness, because time is money.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are other similar projects out there, but none of them suited our needs.
        Some are awesome but were just too much, existing more as reference implementations, when we really just wanted a kickstarter.
        Others were just too little, with puny build systems and unscalable architectures. So we designed <code>ng-scaffolding</code> to be just right.
    </p>
    <h2>What ng-scaffolding is Not</h2>
    <p>
        This is not an example of an AngularJS app. This is a kickstarter.
        If you're looking for an example of what a complete, non-trivial AngularJS app that does something real looks like, complete with a REST backend and authentication and authorization,
        then take a look at <code><a href="https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app">angular-app</a></code>, which does just that, and does it well.

        This section is just a quick introduction to all the stuff that comes pre-packaged with <code>ng-boilerplate</code>.
